## Part 1: App Description

This app is an API app called Day-To-Day Crypto App. The purpose of the app is enable day-trading users to have
a heightened experience while trading by allowing them to know whether the currencies that they choose to buy are
favorable or not favorable and how much money they would have to invest to get a certain amount of that cryptocurrency.
This app uses Coincap and Amdoren APIs to have this functionality.

## Part 2: New

I gained an even greater understanding of API calls and the importance/potential of having a high-level understanding of this
concept. Also, it enabled me to feel more creative than ever before while coding the project because of how many apis exist. So,
by the end of the project, I grew as a programmer by learning how to weave my creativity and coding expertise into a functioning
product.

## Part 3: Retrospect

I would probably not try to change the overlying project file structure prior to not having a high understanding of the way the POM.xml
file of the project was set up. On Sunday, I put all my code into OmegaApp.java because I thought structuring the project like I did for
GalleryApp.java would allow me to complete it much more efficiently. However, the way the POM.xml file was built required there to be code in
the OmegaApp.java and my api files for the FX application to even come up. After I realized this, I had to distribute out my code across the two
files which took an entire day.
